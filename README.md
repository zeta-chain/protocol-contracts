### Codebase

The protocol contracts V2 codebase is separated into two sections:

- `zevm`: contracts deployed on ZetaChain
- `evm`: contracts deployed on EVM connected chains (Ethereum, Base, etc..)

**ZEVM Contracts**

- `GatewayZEVM`: entrypoints for interaction. The users call the gateway contract to initiate cctx. The gateway contract is also the contract calling the target when a smart contract call is initiated on a connected chain
- `ZRC20`: is a ERC20 compliant contract that represents fungible assets from connected chains
- `WZETA`: wrapped ZETA (fork of WETH)

**EVM Contracts**

- `GatewayEVM`: similar to GatewayZEVM for connected chains. Entrypoint for users.
- `ERC20Custody`: hold ERC20 assets being sent to ZetaChain
- `ZetaConnector`: manage ZETA for connected chains. There are two version of the contract:
    - Native: when the ZETA tokens are native to the chain (ZETA where initially deployed as a ERC20 on Ethereum, not emitted fully on ZetaChain). Use lock/unlock model.
    - Non-Native: when ZETA tokens where never native to the chains but withdrawn from ZetaChain. Use mint/burn model.
- TSS (EOA): Threshold-signature-scheme wallet, this address holds the gas token sent to ZetaChain (like Ethers)
