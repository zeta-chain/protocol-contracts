# Deployment

This directory contains script to deploy the protocol contracts on ZetaChain and connected chains.

To execute a deployment script, the general format is:

```
forge script scripts/deploy/<Script>.s.sol --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> --broadcast 
```

A `.env` file should be set up and updated during deployments according to expected env variables in scripts, check `.env.sample` for example on how it should look like.
Currently, `.env.sample` is set with test env variables that can be used to test scripts locally with `anvil` using first account private key.


## Deploying the protocol contracts on connected chains

The GatewayEVM and ERC20Custody contracts must be deployed to setup a new environment on a connected chain.

**GatewayEVM**

The following environment variables must be set in the `.env` file:

- `TSS_ADDRESS`: address of the TSS used on the network
- `GATEWAY_ADMIN_ADDRESS_EVM`: address of the admin
- `ZETA_ERC20_EVM`: address of the ZETA token on the network

Once setup, the contract can be deployed:

```
forge script scripts/deploy/deterministic/DeployGatewayEVM.s.sol \
  --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> \
  --rpc-url <RPC_URL> \
  --verify \
  --etherscan-api-key <ETHERSCAN_API_KEY> \
  --chain-id <CHAIN_ID> \
  --broadcast
```

Note: `verify` and `etherscan-api-key` options are optional for the contract deployment itself. Some other explorers require different options, for example Blockscout:
```
  --verify \
  --verifier blockscout \
  --verifier-url <VERIFIER_URL> \
```

**ERC20Custody**

In addition to the previous environment variables, the following environment variables must be set:

- `ERC20_CUSTODY_ADMIN_ADDRESS_EVM`: address of the admin
- `GATEWAY_PROXY_EVM`: address of the **proxy** gateway contract deployed in previous step

Once setup, the contract can be deployed:

```
forge script scripts/deploy/deterministic/DeployERC20Custody.s.sol \
  --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> \
  --rpc-url <RPC_URL> \
  --verify \
  --etherscan-api-key <ETHERSCAN_API_KEY> \
  --chain-id <CHAIN_ID> \
  --broadcast
```

## Deploying the protocol contracts on ZetaChain

Since ZRC20s are deployed by the protocol, only the `GatewayZEVM` contract needs to be deployed manually on ZetaChain.

The following environment variables must be set in the `.env` file:

- `GATEWAY_ADMIN_ADDRESS_ZEVM`: address of the admin 
- `WZETA`: wrapped ZETA contract address

Once setup, the contract can be deployed:

```
forge script scripts/deploy/deterministic/DeployGatewayZEVM.s.sol \
  --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> \
  --rpc-url <RPC_URL> \
  --verify \
  --verifier blockscout \
  --verifier-url <VERIFIER_URL> \
  --chain-id <CHAIN_ID> \
  --broadcast
```

## Deploying protocol contracts implementation for upgrades

Protocol contracts (Gateway and ERC20Custody) follow ERC1967 standard. The contracts can be upgraded by deploying a new implementation and upgrading to this new implementation.

The implementation contracts don't require environment variables or paramters to be deployed.

**GatewayEVM**

Deploy a wew implementation of the GatewayEVM:

```
forge script scripts/deploy/deterministic/DeployGatewayEVMImplementation.s.sol \
  --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> \
  --rpc-url <RPC_URL> \
  --verify \
  --etherscan-api-key <ETHERSCAN_API_KEY> \
  --chain-id <CHAIN_ID> \
  --broadcast
```

**ERC20Custody**

Deploy a wew implementation of the ERC20Custody:

```
forge script scripts/deploy/deterministic/DeployERC20CustodyImplementation.s.sol \
  --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> \
  --rpc-url <RPC_URL> \
  --verify \
  --etherscan-api-key <ETHERSCAN_API_KEY> \
  --chain-id <CHAIN_ID> \
  --broadcast
```

**GatewayZEVM**

Deploy a wew implementation of the GatewayZEVM:

```
forge script scripts/deploy/deterministic/DeployGatewayZEVMImplementation.s.sol \
  --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> \
  --rpc-url <RPC_URL> \
  --verify \
  --verifier blockscout \
  --verifier-url <VERIFIER_URL> \
  --chain-id <CHAIN_ID> \
  --broadcast
```

After the implementation is deployed, the contract can be upgraded by calling the following function from the admin:

```
upgradeToAndCall(0, <implementation_address>, "")
```

## Simulating a protocol contract upgrade

The scripts in `upgrade` allow to locally simulate the upgrade process with the protocol contract and verify the state is not corrupted.

First a forked localnet must be started in a separate terminal. The RPC will be the connected EVM chain for testing `GatewayEVM` or `ERC20Custody`, or ZetaChain for `GatewayZEVM`

```
anvil --fork-url <rpc>
```
Example:
```
anvil --fork-url https://ethereum-sepolia.rpc.subquery.network/public
anvil --fork-url https://zetachain-athens.g.allthatnode.com/archive/evm
```

The following environment variable must be set:
```
export PROXY_ADDRESS=<proxy address of the contract to test>
export ADMIN_ADDRESS=<address of the admin that upgrade the contract>
```

Then the script can be run.

`GatewayEVM`:
```
forge script scripts/upgrade/SimulateGatewayEVMUpgrade.s.sol --rpc-url http://localhost:8545
```
`ERC20Custody`:
```
forge script scripts/upgrade/SimulateERC20CustodyUpgrade.s.sol --rpc-url http://localhost:8545
```
`GatewayZEVM`:
```
forge script scripts/upgrade/SimulateGatewayZEVMUpgrade.s.sol --rpc-url http://localhost:8545
```

The scripts will log the different state variables of the contract. There is no automatic assertion, the values must be manually checked against the current values of the proxy contract.

These scripts must be maintained in the future to log all eventual new variables.

Example output:

```
Script ran successfully.

```


## Deploying a ZRC20 reference contract

ZRC20 contract is upgradable by the protocol but doesn't follow the `ERC1967Proxy` standard.
The process requires to:
- Deploy a reference for the ZRC20 to upgrade
- Use the `MsgUpdateContractBytecode` message of the blockchain to upgrade the contract using the reference bytecode

The reference must be deployed using the same constructor argument as the base contract.
To obtain the arguments, the following utility script can be used:
```
./scripts/utils/get_zrc20_info.sh <zrc20_address> <rpc>
```

Note: the script requires `cast` CLI (Foundry suite) to be installed.

The command prints the environment variable to put in the `.env` file to deploy the new contract.
Example:
```
SYSTEM_CONTRACT=0xEdf1c3275d13489aCdC6cD6eD246E72458B8795B
ZRC20_NAME=ZetaChain ZRC20 SOL on Solana Devnet
ZRC20_SYMBOL=SOL.SOLANA
ZRC20_DECIMALS=9
ZRC20_CHAIN_ID=901
ZRC20_COIN_TYPE=1
ZRC20_GAS_LIMIT=5000
```

Once the environment variables are set, the ZRC20 can be deployed:
```
forge script scripts/deploy/DeployZRC20.s.sol \
  --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> \
  --rpc-url <RPC_URL> \
  --verify \
  --verifier blockscout \
  --verifier-url <VERIFIER_URL> \
  --chain-id <CHAIN_ID> \
  --broadcast
```

After deployment, the following utility script allows to verify the ZRC20 has been deployed with the correct constructor arguments:
```
./scripts/utils/compare_zrc20_info.sh <base_contract> <reference_contract> <rpc>
```

## Deterministic deployments

Deployment scripts in `deterministic` uses create2 with Foundry (https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/create2-tutorial) to perform deterministic deployment of contracts.
This ensures that the GatewayEVM contract will have the same address on every EVM chain.

Since UUPS proxy is used for the contracts, both implementation and `ERC1967Proxy` are deployed using above technique:

- calculate expected address
- adding a salt to deployment
- basic assertions to verify that deployed address is same as expected

The contract can be upgraded with the following documentation: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-foundry-upgrades. It requires:

- deploy new implementation (doesn't need to be deterministic since proxy address doesn't change)
- use plugin to upgrade proxy
